Short utility programs useful to me, at least.

## absent.py
Determine which files of a folder are not present in another collection of folders.

Use case:
I have some folders of photos - my "library"
I import the photos from my "camera".
I move the new photos around in the library, and possibly rename them.
I delete some of the photos on my camera, but not all.
I take new photos on the camera.
Now I want to import only the new ones....

Note that this applies to other situations:
I might have a series of backup CDs (remember those?) that I want to combine.
Various reorganizations of my music library
....
